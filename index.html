      <h1>1. Bulbasaur is the first Pokemon in the Pokedex.
         <br><hr>
          2. Rhydon is the first Pokemon ever to be created.
          <br><hr>
          3. Slowbro is the only Pokemon that can devolve.
          <br><hr>
          4. Ekans simply reads “Snake” from back to front and Arbok is “Kobra” the other way round.
          <br><hr>
          5. Arcanine was originally supposed to be a legendary Pokemon, but was replaced by Moltres.
          <br><hr>
          6. Mr. Mime can also be a girl, even if the name of the female Pokemon would still include “Mr.”.
          <br><hr>
          7. Azurill has a 25 percent chance to change its gender when it develops.
          <br><hr>
          8. Pikachu (Mouse Pokemon) has a Pokedex number of 25, while Meowth (Cat Pokemon) has a Pokedex number of 52. 
          If you turn each of these two figures, you will notice that they are the opposite of each other, 
          just like cat and mouse.
          <br><hr>
          9. “Pokemon” is not a Japanese word, but a combination of the two English words “pocket” and “monster”.
          <br><hr>
          10. In Japan, the Pokemon move “Splash” did not exist, it was called “Hop” (hopping), 
          which explains why “Splash” is a physical ability and no water ability.
          <br><hr>
          11. There are rumors that Mew and Ditto are almost identical; Ditto seems to be a failed version of Mew. Both weigh 8.8 pounds each, know how to transform, 
          are pink, but blue when iridescent, and can learn every move – even if it is only temporarily for Ditto.
          <br><hr>
          12. Doduo can learn to fly, apparently by moving his legs very fast, as can be seen in Pokemon Stadium.
          <br><hr>
          13. Deino and its evolutions have the German numbers one to three in their name: DEINo, ZWEIlous and HyDREIgon.
          <br><hr>
          14. Gengar is a shadow-like Pokemon, and this “shadow” might be responsible for looking so similar to Clefable.
          <br><hr>
          15. The names of the three legendary birds end with a Spanish number: ArticUNO, ZapDOS and MolTRES.
